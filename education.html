            <h1>My Education</h1>
            <p>
                My academic journey has been an important foundation for my growth in software engineering. 
                Through formal education, I have gained a solid understanding of core computing concepts such as programming fundamentals, data structures, databases, and web technologies. 
                These subjects have helped me develop logical thinking, analytical skills, and a structured approach to problem-solving. 
                Beyond classroom learning, I actively practice what I learn through personal projects, allowing me to reinforce theoretical knowledge with real-world application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Education has also taught me the importance of discipline, collaboration, and continuous learning. 
                Working on assignments, group projects, and research tasks has improved my ability to communicate ideas clearly and work effectively with others. 
                As technology continues to evolve, 
                I view education not as a fixed destination, but as a continuous process that equips me with the skills and mindset needed to adapt and grow in the software engineering field.
