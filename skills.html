                    <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have a strong foundation in frontend development, with practical experience in building responsive and interactive web interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        I focus on creating clean layouts, well-structured code, and visually appealing designs that adapt smoothly across different screen sizes.
                        My goal as a frontend developer is to bridge the gap between design and functionality, ensuring that users interact with intuitive and engaging web applications.

                        My interest in application development comes from a desire to solve real-world problems using technology. 
                        I am building my skills in developing logical, user-focused applications by applying programming principles, problem-solving techniques, and structured design approaches.
                        As I grow in this area, I aim to develop scalable and efficient applications that are both practical and impactful.

                    <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
                    <p>UI/UX design plays a critical role in how users perceive and interact with digital products, and I pay close attention to this aspect in my work. 
                        I focus on designing interfaces that are visually balanced, easy to navigate, and user-friendly. 
                        By considering factors such as color contrast, spacing, typography, and interaction flow, I strive to create experiences that feel natural and intuitive. 
                        I believe that good design is not just about aesthetics, but also about usability and clarity, ensuring that users can achieve their goals effortlessly.
