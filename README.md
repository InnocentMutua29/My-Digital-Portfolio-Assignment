## Web Hosting and Domain Name
1) Domain Name

A domain name is a unique, human-readable address that identifies a website on the internet and represents an individual, organization, or brand. It allows users to access a website easily without needing to remember complex numerical IP addresses. In practice, a domain name is registered through accredited domain registrars such as Namecheap, GoDaddy, or Google Domains.
For a personal portfolio, the domain name would typically reflect the owner’s identity or brand, for example using their name or professional title. A unique domain name helps establish an online presence, improves credibility, and makes the website easy to locate and remember.

2) Web Hosting

Web hosting is a service that provides storage space on a server where website files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images are stored. A reliable web hosting provider ensures that these files are available online and can be accessed by visitors at any time. Hosting services also manage server uptime, security, and performance to ensure smooth access to the website.
For a static personal portfolio website, hosting platforms such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or traditional shared hosting services can be used. These platforms make it possible to publish websites online efficiently while ensuring accessibility and reliability for users.
